From the given system specification for the software of the controller of a connected pumpkin, here are three properties to verify on the system and methods to proceed with their verification:

1. **Property: The pumpkin must light up as soon as it is placed in the dark.**

   - **CTL Property:** Use Computation Tree Logic (CTL) to verify this requirement. The CTL property can be specified as:
     \[
     \text{AG}(\text{dark} \rightarrow \text{AF}(\text{LEDs\_on}))
     \]
     This property states that it is always globally true (AG) that if the pumpkin is placed in the dark, it will eventually (AF) turn on the LEDs.
   
   - **Verification Method:** Model check this CTL property using a model checking tool such as NuSMV. Ensure that the model of the system includes states representing the detection of darkness and the activation of the LEDs.

2. **Property: The pumpkin must sing spooky melodies whenever someone enters the room, except on Halloween night when it must sing the Ghostbusters theme.**

   - **Observer Block:** Create an observer block in SysML to monitor the state of the system.
     - **Normal Condition:** Verify that whenever the presence sensor is triggered (indicating someone has entered the room), the current song being played is a spooky melody.
     - **Halloween Condition:** Verify that on Halloween night, triggering the presence sensor results in the Ghostbusters theme being played.
   
   - **Verification Method:** Implement state-based tests using the observer block to check that the system correctly transitions between playing spooky melodies and the Ghostbusters theme based on the date and presence sensor input. Simulate the system over different scenarios to ensure correct behavior.

3. **Property: The WiFi interface must accurately report the current song being played to the iPumpkin application.**

   - **Observer Block with CTL Property:** Use an observer block to capture the currently played song and its reporting status.
     - **Observer Block:** This block will observe the song currently being played by the pumpkin and the song being reported via the WiFi interface.
     - **CTL Property:** Ensure that the observed and reported songs are always the same.
       \[
       \text{AG}(\text{current\_song} = \text{reported\_song})
       \]
       This property states that it is always globally true (AG) that the song being played by the pumpkin and the song being reported via the WiFi interface are equal.
   
   - **Verification Method:** Perform simulation and model checking. The simulation will involve running test scenarios where various songs are played, and the reported song is checked for consistency. Model checking can be used to verify the CTL property across all possible states.

By following these methods, you can systematically verify the correctness of the connected pumpkin's controller software in terms of its lighting behavior, song selection based on presence and date, and accurate reporting via the WiFi interface.
