Given the system specification for the software controller of the connected pumpkin, here are three properties to verify on the system and how to proceed with their verification:

### Property 1: The pumpkin lights up as soon as it is placed in the dark.
**Verification Method: CTL Property**

- **CTL Property:** AG (dark -> AF lightOn)
  - **Explanation:** For all paths (A), globally (G) if it is dark, then on all paths (A), in the future (F) the light should be on.
- **Procedure:**
  1. **Model the System:** Ensure that the system is modeled in a state-transition diagram within the SysML block diagram.
  2. **Define States and Transitions:** Define states for "dark" and "lightOn" and transitions triggered by the light sensor input.
  3. **Verify Using Model Checker:** Use a model checking tool to verify the CTL property against the system model. If the property holds, the verification is successful; otherwise, the model checker will provide counterexamples for debugging.

### Property 2: On Halloween night, the pumpkin must sing the Ghostbusters theme.
**Verification Method: Observer Block**

- **Observer Block:** Create an observer block that monitors the date and the song being played.
  - **Explanation:** The observer block will check if the date is October 31st and verify that the Ghostbusters theme is being played.
- **Procedure:**
  1. **Create Observer Block:** Design an observer block that has inputs for the date and the current song.
  2. **Monitor Conditions:** Implement logic within the observer block to check if the date is October 31st and the current song is the Ghostbusters theme.
  3. **Simulation:** Run simulations of the system with the observer block integrated to ensure that on Halloween night, the Ghostbusters theme is played. The observer block should assert a violation if any other song is played on October 31st.

### Property 3: The iPumpkin application can trigger the pumpkin to emit a sinister laugh with a click.
**Verification Method: CTL Property**

- **CTL Property:** AG (click -> AF sinisterLaugh)
  - **Explanation:** For all paths (A), globally (G) if a click event occurs, then on all paths (A), in the future (F) the pumpkin will emit a sinister laugh.
- **Procedure:**
  1. **Model the Interaction:** Ensure that the interaction between the iPumpkin application and the pumpkin controller is modeled correctly, including the click event and the resulting action (sinister laugh).
  2. **Define States and Transitions:** Define states for "waitingForClick" and "sinisterLaugh" and transitions triggered by the click input from the WiFi interface.
  3. **Verify Using Model Checker:** Use a model checking tool to verify the CTL property against the system model. The tool should confirm that a click event always leads to the emission of a sinister laugh. If the verification fails, analyze the counterexamples provided.

### Summary
- **Property 1** verifies that the pumpkin lights up in the dark using a CTL property in a model checker.
- **Property 2** verifies that the pumpkin sings the Ghostbusters theme on Halloween using an observer block.
- **Property 3** verifies that the iPumpkin application can trigger a sinister laugh using a CTL property in a model checker.

Each method involves modeling the relevant aspects of the system, defining appropriate states and transitions, and using formal verification tools to ensure the properties hold.
