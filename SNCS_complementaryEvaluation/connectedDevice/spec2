The system to be designed is the software for the controller of a connected pumpkin. The connected pumpkin is a multifunctional vegetable of great versatility. Carved into a grimacing smile, equipped with light and presence sensors, as well as internal LEDs and a powerful speaker, the connected pumpkin lights up as soon as it is placed in the dark and sings spooky melodies whenever someone enters the room where it is placed. It can play any song, except on Halloween night when it must sing the Ghostbusters theme. In addition, the connected pumpkin has a WiFi interface to interact with the iPumpkin application. With this application, the user can know in real time the song being played by the pumpkin, and with a simple click, make it emit a sinister laugh. The functions of the connected pumpkin are managed by a controller that receives data from the sensors and the WiFi interface, sends commands to the LEDs and the speaker, and sends data to the WiFi interface.
