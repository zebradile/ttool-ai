To verify the proper functioning of the smoked salmon packaging line system as described, we can identify three critical properties that need to be verified. We will proceed by specifying these properties and suggesting appropriate verification methods such as CTL properties and observer blocks.

### Property 1: No Overlapping Trays
**Specification:** Machine 1 should not place a tray on top of another tray.

**Verification Method:**
- **CTL Property:** Use Computational Tree Logic (CTL) to specify this property.
    - **CTL Formula:** `AG (¬ (TrayAtMachine1 ∧ TrayAlreadyPresent))`
    - **Explanation:** This formula states that in all global states (AG), it is never the case that Machine 1 places a tray (`TrayAtMachine1`) when a tray is already present (`TrayAlreadyPresent`).

### Property 2: No Salmon Fillet Without a Tray
**Specification:** Machine 2 should not place a salmon fillet on the conveyor if no tray is present in front of it.

**Verification Method:**
- **Observer Block:** Create an observer block to monitor the condition and signal a violation if a salmon fillet is placed without a tray.
    - **Observer Block Design:**
        - Input: Signals indicating the presence of a tray (`TrayPresentMachine2`) and the action of placing a salmon fillet (`PlaceFillet`).
        - Logic: Raise an error if `PlaceFillet` occurs when `TrayPresentMachine2` is false.

### Property 3: No Sealing Without a Tray
**Specification:** Machine 3 should not place and seal a hermetic film on the conveyor if no tray is present in front of it.

**Verification Method:**
- **Observer Block:** Similar to Property 2, use an observer block to ensure Machine 3 operates correctly.
    - **Observer Block Design:**
        - Input: Signals indicating the presence of a tray (`TrayPresentMachine3`) and the action of sealing (`SealTray`).
        - Logic: Raise an error if `SealTray` occurs when `TrayPresentMachine3` is false.

### Verification Steps:

1. **Model the System in SysML:**
    - Create a SysML block diagram representing the conveyor, the three machines, sensors, actuators, and the controller.

2. **Define the Properties:**
    - For each property, define the corresponding CTL formula or observer block logic.

3. **Implement the Verification:**
    - **CTL Properties:**
        - Use a model checker tool that supports CTL (e.g., NuSMV, SPIN) to verify the CTL properties against the system model.
        - Input the CTL formulae and check if the system satisfies these properties.
    - **Observer Blocks:**
        - Design the observer blocks within the SysML model.
        - Simulate the system behavior and use the observer blocks to detect any violations during the simulation.

4. **Analyze the Results:**
    - For CTL properties, analyze the results from the model checker to ensure no counterexamples exist.
    - For observer blocks, review the simulation outputs to confirm that no violations occur during the operation of the machines and conveyor.

By verifying these properties, we can ensure that the system operates safely and as intended, without placing trays on top of each other, placing salmon fillets directly on the conveyor, or sealing without a tray.
