To verify the system specified for the smoked salmon packaging line, we can identify three critical properties to ensure the correct operation and safety of the system. Each property will be verified using different methods, including CTL (Computation Tree Logic) properties and observer blocks. 

### Property 1: Prevention of Tray Overlapping (Machine 1)
**Property Description:** Machine 1 should not place a tray on top of another tray already present on the conveyor.

**Verification Method:** CTL Property

**CTL Formula:** 
- AG (trayPresentInFrontOfMachine1 -> AX (¬trayPlacement))

**Explanation:** This CTL formula asserts that it is always true (A) on all paths (G) that if a tray is present in front of Machine 1 (trayPresentInFrontOfMachine1), then in the next state (X), it should not be possible to place another tray (¬trayPlacement).

**Steps to Verify:**
1. Model the state of the system where trays are present in front of Machine 1.
2. Define the condition for tray placement.
3. Use a model checker to verify that the CTL property holds throughout the system's operation.

### Property 2: Prevention of Salmon Fillet Misplacement (Machine 2)
**Property Description:** Machine 2 should not place a salmon fillet directly on the conveyor if no tray is present.

**Verification Method:** Observer Block

**Observer Block Description:**
- Create an observer block that monitors the state of the conveyor in front of Machine 2.
- This observer checks if a salmon fillet placement action occurs without the presence of a tray.

**Steps to Verify:**
1. Design an observer block in the SysML model that tracks the states of the conveyor and the tray presence in front of Machine 2.
2. Implement logic within the observer block to flag any instance where a salmon fillet is placed without a tray being present.
3. Simulate the system and check if the observer block flags any violations.

### Property 3: Prevention of Hermetic Film Misplacement (Machine 3)
**Property Description:** Machine 3 should not place and seal a hermetic film on the conveyor if no tray is present.

**Verification Method:** CTL Property

**CTL Formula:** 
- AG (trayPresentInFrontOfMachine3 -> AX (¬filmSealing))

**Explanation:** This CTL formula asserts that it is always true (A) on all paths (G) that if a tray is present in front of Machine 3 (trayPresentInFrontOfMachine3), then in the next state (X), it should not be possible to place and seal a hermetic film (¬filmSealing).

**Steps to Verify:**
1. Model the state of the system where trays are present in front of Machine 3.
2. Define the condition for hermetic film sealing.
3. Use a model checker to verify that the CTL property holds throughout the system's operation.

### Verification Procedure:
1. **Model Creation:** Ensure the SysML model accurately represents the system's components, states, and transitions, including the conveyor belt, machines, sensors, and actuators.
2. **Property Specification:** Clearly define the properties to be verified using CTL formulas and observer blocks.
3. **Model Checking and Simulation:** 
   - For CTL properties, use a model checking tool to verify the specified properties.
   - For observer blocks, simulate the system and observe if any predefined conditions are violated.
4. **Analysis and Correction:** If any property is violated during verification, analyze the cause and update the system model or control logic to ensure compliance.

By following these verification steps, we can ensure that the system adheres to the specified requirements and operates safely and correctly.
