Based on the system specification of the smoked salmon packaging line, here are three properties to verify on the system along with approaches to verify them:

### 1. Machine 1 should not place a tray on top of another tray
#### Property to Verify
No two trays should ever be present at the same position on the conveyor belt.

#### Approach to Verify
- **CTL Property**: 
  - Express the property in Computation Tree Logic (CTL) as `AG (¬(tray_position_i = tray_position_j))`, where `i` and `j` are indices for trays and `tray_position` indicates the position of the trays on the conveyor.
- **Observer Block**:
  - Design an observer block that monitors the positions of trays on the conveyor belt. This block will assert an error if it detects more than one tray at the same position.

### 2. Machine 2 should not place a salmon fillet on the conveyor if no tray is present in front of it
#### Property to Verify
A salmon fillet should only be placed if a tray is present in front of Machine 2.

#### Approach to Verify
- **CTL Property**:
  - Use a CTL formula such as `AG (¬(place_fillet_action ∧ ¬tray_present_in_front_of_Machine_2))` to ensure that the action of placing a fillet does not occur when no tray is detected.
- **Observer Block**:
  - Create an observer block that checks the condition of the tray sensor in front of Machine 2 each time the fillet placement action is triggered. The observer will flag an error if the fillet placement occurs without a tray present.

### 3. Machine 3 should not place and seal a hermetic film on the conveyor if no tray is present in front of it
#### Property to Verify
The sealing action should only be performed if a tray is present in front of Machine 3.

#### Approach to Verify
- **CTL Property**:
  - Define a CTL property like `AG (¬(seal_action ∧ ¬tray_present_in_front_of_Machine_3))` to ensure that the sealing action does not occur when there is no tray.
- **Observer Block**:
  - Implement an observer block to monitor the tray sensor in front of Machine 3. This block will verify that the sealing action is only initiated when a tray is detected.

### Verification Procedures
1. **Model Checking using CTL Properties**:
   - Develop a formal model of the packaging line in a model checking tool (such as NuSMV or UPPAAL).
   - Encode the CTL properties mentioned above.
   - Run the model checker to verify that the properties hold in all possible states of the system. If the model checker finds a counterexample, analyze and correct the system design.

2. **Observer Block Simulation**:
   - Implement the observer blocks within the system model.
   - Simulate the system operation in a tool like MATLAB/Simulink or another system simulation environment.
   - The observer blocks will continuously monitor the system's behavior during simulation and will flag any violations of the specified properties.
   - Review and address any flagged issues to ensure compliance with the requirements.

### Additional Considerations
- **Concurrency**:
  - Given that the machines and conveyor are managed in parallel, special attention should be given to synchronizing actions and verifying that interleaved operations do not lead to violations.
- **Real-Time Constraints**:
  - Ensure that the timing of sensor readings and actuator commands are accurately modeled, as delays or timing mismatches could lead to incorrect behavior not captured by logical properties alone.

These steps will help in verifying that the system operates correctly and adheres to the specified constraints.
