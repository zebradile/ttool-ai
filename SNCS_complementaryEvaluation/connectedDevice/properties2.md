Based on the given system specification for the connected pumpkin, here are three properties to verify on the system and the methods to verify them:

### Property 1: The pumpkin lights up when placed in the dark
**Property Description:** The connected pumpkin must light up as soon as it is placed in the dark.

**Verification Method:** Use a Computation Tree Logic (CTL) property.

**CTL Property:** AG (Dark -> AF LightsOn)
- **Explanation:** For all states (AG), if the system detects darkness (Dark), it should eventually (AF) lead to the lights turning on (LightsOn).

**Verification Steps:**
1. Define the states in the system model where the sensor detects darkness (`Dark`).
2. Define the states where the internal LEDs are on (`LightsOn`).
3. Use a model checker to verify the CTL property AG (Dark -> AF LightsOn) against the system model to ensure that whenever darkness is detected, the LEDs eventually turn on.

### Property 2: The pumpkin plays the Ghostbusters theme on Halloween night
**Property Description:** The connected pumpkin must sing the Ghostbusters theme on Halloween night.

**Verification Method:** Use an observer block.

**Observer Block:**
- **Description:** Create an observer block that monitors the date and the song being played. The observer will check if the song played on Halloween night is always the Ghostbusters theme.

**Verification Steps:**
1. Implement an observer block within the SysML model that tracks the current date and the song currently being played.
2. Define a condition in the observer block to verify that if the current date is October 31st, the song being played is the Ghostbusters theme.
3. Simulate the system for different dates and ensure the observer block correctly reports compliance or violation of the property.

### Property 3: Real-time song updates via the iPumpkin application
**Property Description:** The user must be able to know the song being played by the pumpkin in real-time through the iPumpkin application.

**Verification Method:** Use a CTL property.

**CTL Property:** AG (PlayingSong -> AF AppUpdate)
- **Explanation:** For all states (AG), if the pumpkin is playing a song (PlayingSong), it should eventually (AF) result in the application receiving an update about the song being played (AppUpdate).

**Verification Steps:**
1. Define the states in the system model where a song is being played (`PlayingSong`).
2. Define the states where the iPumpkin application is updated with the current song (`AppUpdate`).
3. Use a model checker to verify the CTL property AG (PlayingSong -> AF AppUpdate) against the system model to ensure that whenever a song is played, the application is updated in real time.

### Summary
To verify these properties, the process involves:
1. Modeling the necessary states and transitions in the SysML block diagram.
2. Applying CTL properties to ensure certain conditions are always or eventually met.
3. Implementing observer blocks to monitor and validate specific behaviors in the system during simulations. 

Using these methods provides a rigorous approach to ensure the connected pumpkin system meets its specified requirements.
