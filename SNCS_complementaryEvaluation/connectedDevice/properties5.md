To verify the system, we can focus on three key properties based on the given specification. Here are the properties and the methods to verify them:

### 1. Property: Automatic Lighting in the Dark
**Specification:** The connected pumpkin lights up as soon as it is placed in the dark.

#### Verification Method:
- **CTL Property:** Use Computation Tree Logic (CTL) to express the property that whenever the light sensor detects darkness, the LEDs turn on.
    - **CTL Formula:** AG (Dark -> AF LED_On)
        - **AG**: For all paths, in all states
        - **Dark**: Condition where the light sensor detects darkness
        - **AF**: For all paths, eventually
        - **LED_On**: State where the LEDs are turned on
- **Observer Block:** Create an observer block in the SysML model that monitors the state of the light sensor and the LEDs. The observer block should assert that whenever the light sensor reports darkness, the LEDs turn on within a specific time frame.

### 2. Property: Play Ghostbusters Theme on Halloween Night
**Specification:** The connected pumpkin must sing the Ghostbusters theme on Halloween night.

#### Verification Method:
- **CTL Property:** Use CTL to specify that on Halloween night, the system plays the Ghostbusters theme.
    - **CTL Formula:** AG (Halloween_Night -> AF Ghostbusters_Theme_Playing)
        - **AG**: For all paths, in all states
        - **Halloween_Night**: Condition where the date is Halloween night
        - **AF**: For all paths, eventually
        - **Ghostbusters_Theme_Playing**: State where the Ghostbusters theme is being played
- **Observer Block:** Design an observer block that checks the date and the song being played. It should verify that on Halloween night, the song being played is the Ghostbusters theme.

### 3. Property: Real-Time Song Information via WiFi Interface
**Specification:** The iPumpkin application can know in real time the song being played by the pumpkin.

#### Verification Method:
- **CTL Property:** Use CTL to ensure that whenever a song is playing, the WiFi interface updates the iPumpkin application in real time.
    - **CTL Formula:** AG (Song_Playing -> AF WiFi_Update)
        - **AG**: For all paths, in all states
        - **Song_Playing**: Condition where a song is being played
        - **AF**: For all paths, eventually
        - **WiFi_Update**: State where the WiFi interface has updated the iPumpkin application
- **Observer Block:** Implement an observer block that monitors the song being played and the messages sent through the WiFi interface. The block should confirm that any change in the song is promptly reflected in the updates sent to the iPumpkin application.

### Verification Process:
1. **Modeling:** Ensure that the SysML block diagram accurately represents all components, sensors, and interfaces of the connected pumpkin system.
2. **Simulation:** Simulate the system behavior using the modeled blocks and observer blocks to check if the specified properties hold true under various scenarios.
3. **Formal Verification:** Apply formal verification techniques using CTL properties to prove mathematically that the system satisfies the given specifications. Tools such as model checkers can be used to automate this process.
4. **Testing:** Conduct real-world testing to ensure that the system behaves as expected under practical conditions, verifying that the observer blocks correctly monitor and assert the required properties.

By following these methods, we can rigorously verify that the connected pumpkin system meets its specifications and behaves correctly under different conditions.
