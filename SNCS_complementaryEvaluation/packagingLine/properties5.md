To verify the system based on the provided specification, we can focus on three critical properties:

1. **No Tray Overlap**: Machine 1 must not place a tray on top of another tray already on the conveyor.
2. **No Salmon on Conveyor without Tray**: Machine 2 must not place a salmon fillet directly on the conveyor without a tray being present.
3. **No Sealing without Tray**: Machine 3 must not seal a tray directly on the conveyor without a tray being present.

To verify these properties, we can use Computation Tree Logic (CTL) properties or observer blocks in the context of model checking. Here's how we would proceed:

### Property 1: No Tray Overlap

#### Verification Method: CTL Property

**CTL Property**: 
- \( AG(\text{tray\_position\_free} \Rightarrow \neg \text{Machine1\_place\_tray}) \)

This CTL property states that globally (G) for all paths (A), if the position on the conveyor belt is free (tray_position_free), Machine 1 should not place a tray (Machine1_place_tray) if there is already a tray present.

### Property 2: No Salmon on Conveyor without Tray

#### Verification Method: Observer Block

**Observer Block**:
- Create an observer block that monitors the condition where Machine 2 places a salmon fillet. The observer block will check the presence of a tray before allowing the action.

```sysml
block ObserverNoSalmonWithoutTray {
  boolean tray_present;
  boolean place_salmon;

  context Machine2 {
    state: {
      if (place_salmon && !tray_present) {
        error("Salmon placed without tray");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This observer block checks whether the `place_salmon` action occurs while `tray_present` is false. If it does, an error is raised, indicating a violation of the property.

### Property 3: No Sealing without Tray

#### Verification Method: CTL Property

**CTL Property**:
- \( AG(\text{tray\_position\_free} \Rightarrow \neg \text{Machine3\_seal\_tray}) \)

This CTL property ensures that globally (G) for all paths (A), if the position on the conveyor belt is free (tray_position_free), Machine 3 should not attempt to seal a tray (Machine3_seal_tray) if there is no tray present.

### Implementation of Verification

To implement these verifications:

1. **Model Checking with CTL**:
   - Use a model checker (e.g., NuSMV, SPIN) to verify the CTL properties against the system model.
   - Input the system model and CTL properties into the model checker and analyze the results.

2. **Observer Blocks**:
   - Implement observer blocks within a simulation environment (e.g., MATLAB/Simulink, UML tools with SysML support).
   - Run simulations to observe the system behavior and verify the conditions specified in the observer blocks.

By using both CTL properties and observer blocks, we can ensure a comprehensive verification approach, covering formal verification (CTL) and runtime monitoring (observer blocks) to validate the critical properties of the smoked salmon packaging line system.
